<h1>The objective of this page is about my educational background<br>Let's get to know each other!</h1>
<p>My learning journey began in 2014 when I was just four years old at Sydney which was a local school in my village. I officially started primary school in 2015 at
"សាលាបឋមសិក្សាអ្នកឧកញ៉ាមហាភក្ដីហ៊ុននាង បាក់ខែង", where I studied from Grade 1 to Grade 6 until 2019. 
Those early years helped me build strong foundations in reading, writing, and understanding the world around me.
In 2020, I began my secondary education (Grade 7 to 9) at "Beltei International School", where I continued to grow academically and personally.
Later, in Grade 9, I transferred to "Prek Leap New Generation School", where I found new challenges and opportunities to develop further.
Currently, I’m in Grade 10 at "Prek Leap New Generation School", beginning my high school years (2024–now). As a high school student,
I’m more motivated than ever to learn deeply, improve my skills, and prepare for the future. Every step of my education has shaped who I am,
and I’m excited for what lies ahead.</p>
